# SpeedBuild
SpeedBuild is an AI-powered development tool that helps developers clone and customize complex features across Django projects (with support for other frameworks coming soon). It captures proven implementations as templates and uses AI to handle customization and integration, turning days of development into minutes.

## How it works

1. Create templates from existing features
2. Store and share templates via GitHub
3. Use our AI agent to implement and customize templates in new projects

## Perfect for teams looking to:

Standardize feature implementations
Reduce repetitive coding
Maintain consistency across projects
Speed up development of common features
